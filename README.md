# CosmoCraft: Chain Creation Guide

Welcome to the CosmoCraft, your comprehensive solution for creating Cosmos blockchains with unparalleled customization and ease. This guide will walk you through the initial steps to create your Cosmos blockchain using our intuitive UI tool, highlighting the customizations available at your fingertips.

## Getting Started

Creating a Cosmos blockchain is a seamless process with CosmoCraft. Start by accessing our UI tool, which guides you through each step, ensuring you can customize your chain according to your specific needs.

### Step 1: Chain Basics

- **Chain Name**: Give your blockchain a unique identity. This name will be used to identify your chain across the Cosmos network.
- **Bech32 Prefix**: This prefix is crucial for generating addresses on your blockchain. Choose a prefix that reflects your chain's identity.
- **Binary Name**: Define the executable name of your blockchain's node software. This name will be used when running your nodes.
- **Denomination**: Specify the token denomination for your blockchain's native currency. This will be used in transactions and balances.
- **Validator Count**: Decide on the number of validators you want to start with. This is crucial for your chain's consensus and security.

### Step 2: Modules Selection

CosmoCraft's strength lies in its modular architecture, allowing you to pick and choose the functionality your blockchain requires.

#### Default Modules

Your chain will come equipped with essential modules that form the backbone of most Cosmos blockchains:

- **Staking**: Essential for any Proof of Stake (PoS) blockchain, allowing token holders to stake their tokens as collateral to validate transactions.
- **NFT**: Supports the creation and management of Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs), enabling a wide range of use cases from digital art to certification.

#### Interested Modules

Enhance your blockchain's capabilities by selecting from an array of available modules:

- **Proof of Authority (PoA)**: Ideal for permissioned networks where validators are known entities.
- **TokenFactory**: Create and manage multiple tokens within your blockchain ecosystem.
- **GlobalFee**: Implement network-wide transaction fees, adjustable according to your governance model.
- **IBC-PacketForward**: Leverage the Inter-Blockchain Communication protocol for cross-chain interactions.
- **CosmWasm**: Introduce smart contracts into your chain, written in Rust, facilitating complex on-chain logic.
- **Wasm-Light-Client**: Enable light clients of other blockchains to verify your chain's state, crucial for cross-chain services.
- **Ignite CLI**: Utilize this powerful command-line interface to streamline your development and deployment processes.

### Step 3: Submission

Once you've tailored your chain's settings to your liking, submit your configuration through our UI. Our backend processes these configurations and kickstarts the generation of your new Cosmos chain.


# CosmoCraft: Deployment Guide

After creating your custom Cosmos blockchain with CosmoCraft, the next critical step is deploying your chain. This guide provides a detailed overview of the deployment process, including options for CI/CD, cloud support, validator management, security considerations, testnet setup, and automated testing.

## Continuous Integration and Deployment (CI/CD)

CosmoCraft integrates a robust CI/CD pipeline, automating the build, test, and deployment phases of your blockchain. This ensures that your chain is always up to date with the latest code changes and security patches.

### How it Works

1. **Code Pushes**: Any code pushed to the main branch of your chain's GitHub repository triggers the CI/CD pipeline.
2. **Automated Testing**: The pipeline runs a series of automated tests to ensure that new code changes do not introduce errors or vulnerabilities.
3. **Deployment**: Upon successful testing, the pipeline automatically deploys the changes to your chain, ensuring minimal downtime and seamless updates.

## Cloud Support

CosmoCraft supports deployment on various cloud platforms, giving you the flexibility to host your blockchain in the environment that best suits your needs.

### Supported Platforms

- **AWS**
- **Google Cloud Platform**
- **Azure**
- **DigitalOcean**
- And more, offering a range of options for scalability, reliability, and geographical distribution.

## Validator Management

Validators play a crucial role in the security and consensus of your Cosmos blockchain. CosmoCraft offers options for both self-managed and fully managed validators.

### Self-Managed Validators

- Ideal for teams with the technical capability to manage their infrastructure.
- Provides complete control over your validators, including hardware specifications, network configurations, and security measures.

### Fully Managed Validators

- A hassle-free option where CosmoCraft takes care of validator setup, maintenance, and monitoring.
- Ensures your validators are always online and up to date with the latest security practices.

## Security Considerations

Security is paramount in blockchain deployment. CosmoCraft incorporates several security measures:

- **Automated Security Scans**: Regularly scans your codebase and infrastructure for vulnerabilities.
- **Encryption**: All data in transit and at rest are encrypted to protect against unauthorized access.
- **Access Controls**: Implements strict access controls and authentication mechanisms to safeguard your blockchain infrastructure.

## Testnet Deployment

Before deploying your blockchain to the mainnet, CosmoCraft provides a testnet environment. This allows you to:

- **Test with Multiple Validators**: Simulate real-world conditions with multiple validators to ensure your blockchain operates as expected under various scenarios.
- **Automated Testing**: Run automated tests to validate transactions, smart contracts, and consensus mechanisms without risking real assets.

### Benefits of Testnet Deployment

- Identifies potential issues in a controlled environment.
- Allows for performance benchmarking and optimization.
- Provides a safe space for developers to interact with your blockchain.
